## 📖 About The Project

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience within the cybersecurity domain. It was built entirely from scratch to demonstrate a strong understanding of core web development principles without relying on frameworks. The goal was to create a visually engaging, high-performance, and fully responsive site that effectively communicates my capabilities to potential employers.
